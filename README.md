# Radar
A simple program to controll a servo with a sodar(so not really radar) module.
Covers a 4 ft radius across 180 degrees, with accuracy within a 1cm.

This project required direct controlling of hardware, trigonometry calculations and conversians to the cardesian plane to create 
an image of what the module "sees". "firstRadar.png" illustrates the output.

uses Basic stamp microprossessor and PBasic 2.5
